## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in git-mob, please report it responsibly:

### Reporting Process

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Instead, please use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/Mubashwer/git-mob/security) of this repository
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the vulnerability report form with as much detail as possible

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Any suggested fixes or mitigations (if you have them)

### Response Timeline

- We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within **1 week**
- We aim to provide an initial assessment within **2-3 weeks**
- We will keep you updated on our progress toward a fix
- Once a fix is available, we will coordinate with you on disclosure timing

Please note that this is a personal project maintained in spare time, so response times may vary.

### What to Expect

- **If accepted**: We will work on a fix and release a security update. You will be credited for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- **If declined**: We will provide a clear explanation of why the report does not qualify as a security vulnerability

Thank you for helping to keep git-mob secure!
